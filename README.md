### Quick Start

Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crossoufire/mylists.git
   cd mylists
   ```

2. **Install deps**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Configure the env file**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (you can copy from `.env.example`):
   Update it with your credentials and configuration values.
   See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for more info.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Initialize Database**
   Initialize a new SQLite database in the `instance` directory.
   ```bash
   bun run new:db
   ```

5. **Run the Dev Server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
6. **Create a new user**
   You can create a new user with different roles (user, manager, admin) without email verification or OAuth2 setup using the CLI:
   ```bash
   bun run cli -- create-user \
     --email admin@example.com \
     --password "change-me-strong-password" \
     --username admin \
     --role admin
   ```

### Docker Deployment

Docker Compose deployment is documented in [docs/docker-deployment.md](./docs/docker-deployment.md).

The default Docker stack is local-only on `http://localhost:3000` and includes the app, Redis,
and the daily maintenance cron container. Public HTTPS should be handled by your own reverse proxy
or tunnel setup. PostHog is optional and disabled when its public key is empty.

### Redis Setup

Redis caching is **optional for dev** and **mandatory for prod**.

- In **dev**, set:
  ```bash
  REDIS_ENABLED=false
  ```
- In **prod**, ensure Redis is available and configured:
  ```bash
  REDIS_ENABLED=true
  REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-instance:6379
  ```

Redis is used for caching, session/state management, and performance optimization.
The app will not build without it (but it can be changed of course, you do you :)).

---

### LLM Integration (Optional)

The LLM is **exclusively used to generate genre data for books** since Google Books does not provide genre metadata.
You can choose how this background task runs:

1. **Manually**, by executing it with the CLI
2. **Automatically**, using a scheduled cron job
